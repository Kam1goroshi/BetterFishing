## Key Features

In Valheim you earn exp everytime you reel, regardless of how difficult it was.<br>
This mod lets you farm exp while focusing on catching high quality fish instead

 
* Modifiable exp multipliers
* Exp multiplier from bait type used
* Exp multiplier from fish grade

With this mod, you can improve your fishing skill faster by catching better fish. Additionally you could make "training ponds", where you can throw your fish and refish them to become a better fisher.
## How To Use

Valheim needs to be launched atleast once to generate files. To clone and run this application, you'll need a mod launcher like [r2modman](https://r2modman.com/download/) or to manually setup [BepInEx](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html) and drag and drop BetterFishing.dll in the appropriate folder. 

After the mod is installed, launch it with mods atleast once to generate its config files


## Download

You can download the latest version of this mod on [github](https://github.com/Kam1goroshi/BetterFishing/releases) or in [thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/Kam1goroshi/BetterFishing/)


## Roadmap

I am not sure if I will continue this project. But some ideas I have:
- Fishing Bags to store your baits
- Disable exp from reeling without a fish hooked

Merges are welcome if someone wants to implement something
